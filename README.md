# Backend README
This project provides a dashboard that displays various measurements collected by a climate sensor robot, including cO2, temperature, humidity, particulate matter and air pressure. Additionally, the dashboard shows the location of the sensor robot.

The data displayed on the dashboard is collected from TheThingsNetwork, where the climate sensor robot sends its data and location. The data is then stored in a PostgreSQL data server for easy access and analysis.
